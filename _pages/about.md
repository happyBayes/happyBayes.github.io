our roadmap
======

Phase 1: Launch of the Basic BaaS Version
------
Introducing a foundational BaaS platform that integrates a privacy-enhanced computing engine, microservice AI programming components, dynamic defense sandbox, and global multi-payment templates. This provides users with a privacy-protecting, highly secure, enterprise-grade microservice AI programming tool.

Phase 2: Building a Full-Chain AI Programming Ecosystem Collaboration
------
[] Collaborate with AI programming tools like Lovable to establish an AI full-stack development protocol, enabling deep integration between BaaS and AI frontend programming tools. 
[] Release a hybrid cloud orchestration engine, integrating with public cloud databases to achieve cloud-native convergence, supporting one-click orchestration and deployment across platforms like Tencent Cloud, AWS, Azure, and GCP. 
[] Launch an early partner program (50+ enterprise integrations), building benchmark use cases in domains such as e-commerce, OTA, Web3, gaming, and social networking.

Phase 3: Release of BaaS Pro Version
------
Upgrade the product to target high-value scenarios, offering globalized AI product development capabilities. Provide a comprehensive global payment transaction risk control solution, leveraging anti-fraud and dynamic risk governance algorithms to address payment challenges in multiple scenarios, including e-commerce, gaming, OTA, Web3, and social networking.

Phase 4. Industrial Software Interoperability
------
Through the MCP protocol and AI-driven interface technology, the BaaS platform achieves seamless integration with over 20 commonly used industrial software applications, such as CAD, CAE, and GIS. This enhances the efficiency of customized industrial software development and reduces operational and maintenance costs.

Phase 5: Continuous Improvement of the Product Ecosystem
------
Build a developer community with a repository of plug-and-play use case projects across multiple scenarios. Launch an AI microservice product trading platform to connect algorithm demand and supply sides. Lead the development of an AI microservice interaction protocol, establishing it as the de facto standard for next-generation BaaS.
